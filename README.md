# Drill Down

A personalized social platform combining introspection, AI-driven insights, and time-locked interactions.

## Overview

This project expands on traditional social media by introducing TimeBombs —posts that unlock at a future date— allowing users to create nostalgic and time-based interactions.

By tagging content, users can explore evolving interests, track personal trends over time, and gain AI-driven insights into their posting habits.

The platform provides a generative pipeline to reward user engagement with personalized content, turning participation into a meaningful, value-driven experience.
