# Drill Down

This project looks to emulate the typical interactions from a social network: you can create users, who can add friends, create, tag and comment on posts, as well as interact with others via messaging. It also adds new interesting functionalities, such as `Time Bombs`*

It consists of a Web App that should eventually serve as a framework to drive a render pipepline, to reward the user with a personalized content.
