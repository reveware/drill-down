**What is drill-down?**
Is a web application, that bridges between social media behavior (posting  & hash-tagging) and a 3D world built over a public ledger (blockchain).

**What's drill-down for?**
drill-down is for record keeping experiences. Users can use tag-threading to backtrack their own posts, as well as their friends.

They also will get unique non-fungible collectibles of the scenes as they visit them with time capsules. 

**How does drill-down work?**

Users can create post in order to build their blog-like profile. Using tags contributes to creating an overall `THEME` for that user, and those themes are mapped to either pre-built 3D renders, or to 3D prop objects that can be used to set up a `SCENE`.

Each user, can visit a `SCENE` of the world using `Time Capsules`. Those capsules, in reality are just scheduled `Messages` sent either by the users themselves, or their friends -- If they've earned it -- .

Each message contains a simple web2 tagged post on creation,  which will be processed by an internal service, and stored on a private/public ledger. 

An scheduler service will then await, and trigger the rendering (& maybe hosting) actions, and send a message to the user that their Capsule is ready.
