### What is drill-down?
Is a web application, that bridges between a social media app (posting & hash-tagging) to a personalized 3D world.


### How does drill-down work?

**Post, tagging & world building**
Users can create post in order to build their blog-like profile. By doing so, the system generates unique `Assets` for them, by extracting information from the posts ( via tags, image recognition, post-publishing surveys).

Extracted information builds a theme for the user, and is mapped to either existing 3D assets, or to outsourcing tasks to produce them, 

The assets and theme are used to populate `ROOM` in online POV FPS servers, filled with personalized objects.

Users will be able to visit another user's room (based on privacy preferences), by visiting their profile the room is also available for "time-travelling"

Generated Assets are available for review by each user in an "inventory" action, where users might be able to trade them.

**Chatbot companion**
In order to obtain enough context about the user to be able to generate assets for them, `SURVEYS` will have to be made to them, in order to know their preferences and tastes. This will be done through a ChatBot companion, which is in-charge of populating JSON objects that describe the scene in the room.
 
These surveys can be made at different times, such as after registration,  after posting (if no relevant information was extracted from the post), or even at at random times. 
  
### What's drill-down for?

For record keeping memories. Users can use tag-threading to backtrack their own posts, as well as their friends.
  
They also will get unique personalized collectibles (Assets) as incentive for interacting in the network, and they will be able to explore them in a POV world.


### Who uses drill-down?
Anyone who enjoys maintaining an online souvenir-like history.
